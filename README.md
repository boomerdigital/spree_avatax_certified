SpreeAvataxCertified is the *only* [officially certified Avatax solution](http://www.avalara.com/avalara-certified/) that integrates with SpreeCommerce.  With this extension you can add instantaneous sales tax decisions to your store.

From Avalara's own explanation of the certification program:

> Relax. It’s certified.
>
> Our “Certified for AvaTax” Program features integrations that perform at the highest level, providing the best possible customer experience.

> Avalara’s partners who have created certified integrations for AvaTax have demonstrated that those integrations contain elements which are essential to providing customers with easy-to-use software that gives accurate sales tax calculations. The certification criteria used to demonstrate these elements are based on Avalara’s years of experience integrating into ERP, ecommerce and point-of-sale applications.
